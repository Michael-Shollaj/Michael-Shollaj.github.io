        <br>
        Valhalla Awaits Me was built from scratch, and it took me 8 months to create this game
        <br>
        <br>
        Game contains enemies with different behavior and different obstacles, which makes the game more difficult and challenging
        <br>
        <br>
        Player should collect all orbs to open the door to go to another level, but to do this, long journey waits for player
        <br>
        <br>
        This game is about a viking, who wants to go to his family, but enemies would try everything to not allow him to go to his family, so we have to defeat them, and we meet family
        <br>
